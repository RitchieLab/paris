== Version 1.1.3 ==

Fixes:

1. Now filters out SNPs from the variations database which have more than one genomic position, instead of using up to one position per chromosome.

2. Now allows for multiple SNPs in the variations database to share the same genomic position, instead of silently choosing only one.

3. Now correctly applies GENE_BOUNDARY_EXTENSION to both ends of the gene, instead of only the upstream end.

4. Now correctly handles overlapping LD feature regions, instead of occasionally missing one or more that should have matched a SNP or gene.

5. Now discards input SNPs with malformed RSIDs, instead of trying to parse them (i.e. "7:67602:A_AT" is no longer parsed as "rs7").

6. Now accepts input SNPs on chromosome 26/MT.

7. Now allows the same RSID to be input more than once and uses both, instead of silently dropping one.

== Version 1.1.2 ==

Fixes:

1. Added check that a bin has enough features within it to run permutation testing on a given pathway or group.  As PARIS selects without replacement and excludes the original features from the permutation test, it will now not run a permutation test on a pathway that cannot select enough features from a bin.

== Version 1.1.1 ==

Fixes:

1. Recognizes multiple alias names from database for genes when user-defined pathway option selected

2.  No longer counts features in the pathways as bin draws and no longer counts repeated features as bin draws during permutation testing.  Previously, although a feature that was drawn multiple times would only be checked once for significance during permutation testing, a replacement for it was not selected.  Therefore, the number of randomly drawn features checked for significance might be less than the total features in the original pathway.  That could result in a lower p value score in some cases. 

== Version 1.1.0 ==

1. Replaced SOCI with direct SQLite API calls to database so application no longer needs SOCI library installation

== Version 1.0.0 ==

1. Initial release
